This project constaints the current PDB code base, as well as a reasonably
extensive example of how to use the PDB API.  Builing the project produces two 
executables:

Executables/buildDB
Executables/queryDB

Once you build the project, begin by un-zipping and un-taring 20News.tar.gz.
Then, run Executables/buildDB, followed by Executables/queryDB.

********************************************************************************

Run "scons" to build all default targets.  Optionally add "-k" to keep building
after errors, or "-j<num>" to build multiple targets simultaneously: these two
flags work here as they do when using "make".

To remove generated files use "scons -c".  This is akin to "make clean".

Run "scons --help" for more information.
